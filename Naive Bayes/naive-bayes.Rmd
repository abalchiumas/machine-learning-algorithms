```{r}
library(e1071)
```


```{r}
credit = read.csv('Credit.csv')
credit
```

It's needed to transform the class into a factor for the algorithm to work
```{r}
credit$class = as.factor(credit$class)
```

Holdout method
```{r}
smpl = sample(2,nrow(credit), replace = T, prob = c(0.7,0.3))
smpltrain = credit[smpl == 1,]
smpltest = credit[smpl == 2,]
```


```{r}
model = naiveBayes(class ~ ., smpltrain)
model
```

Creating a confusion matrix
```{r}
prdct = predict(model, smpltest)
confusion = table(smpltest$class, prdct)
confusion
```
Checking the model accuracy
```{r}
acc1 = (confusion[1] + confusion[4])/sum(confusion)
acc1

acc2 = (confusion[2] + confusion[3])/sum(confusion)
acc2
```
