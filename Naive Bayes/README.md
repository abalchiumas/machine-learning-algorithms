The [Holdout Method](https://towardsdatascience.com/validating-your-machine-learning-model-25b4c8643fb7) was used to program this R notebook.

The [Naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) algorithm was created using a generic .csv, ['Credit.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/german-credit).

It's main goal is to classify wheter a person should receive credit or not from the bank.

The model achieved an accuracy of 73.43%.
