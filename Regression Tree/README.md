# Regression Tree

This [regression tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) was created with the [Holdout Method](https://towardsdatascience.com/validating-your-machine-learning-model-25b4c8643fb7), which is the simplest training method available.

The following tree was generated using one of the built-in R datasets, Iris.



To [evaluate the method](https://towardsdatascience.com/metrics-to-evaluate-your-machine-learning-algorithm-f10ba6e38234), the *accuracy* function was used, which is part of the *forecast* library.
