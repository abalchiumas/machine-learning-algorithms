# Random Forest and Support Vector Machine

The [Holdout Method](https://towardsdatascience.com/validating-your-machine-learning-model-25b4c8643fb7) was used to program this R notebook.

The [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) method was used to sort the most important variables presented in the .csv used, ['Credit.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/german-credit).

After sorting, an increase in the [Support Vector Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support-vector_machine) algorithm accuracy was seen.
