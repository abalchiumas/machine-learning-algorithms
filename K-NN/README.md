# K-NN

The [Holdout Method](https://towardsdatascience.com/validating-your-machine-learning-model-25b4c8643fb7) was used to program this R notebook.

The [K-NN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm was used to cluster neighbouring Species from Iris, a built-in R dataset.

The model achieved an accuracy of 97.91%.
