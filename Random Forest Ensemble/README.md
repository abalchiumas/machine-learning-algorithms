# Random Forest Ensemble

The [Holdout Method](https://towardsdatascience.com/validating-your-machine-learning-model-25b4c8643fb7), which is the simplest method available, was used to program this R notebook.

This [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm was created using a generic .csv, ['Credit.csv'](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/german-credit).

It's main goal is to classify wheter a person should receive credit or not from the bank.

After creating a confusion matrix, the model achieved an accuracy of 77.85%.
